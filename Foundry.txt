Forge can re-run your tests when you make changes to your files using === forge test --watch.

By default, only changed test files are re-run. If you want to re-run all tests on a change, you can use ======= forge test --watch --run-all.


How to test specific file:

		forge test --match-path test/Counter.t.sol

How to test and also a gas report generate:

		forge test --match-path test/Counter.t.sol --gas-report


------------ Remappings ----------

		forge install Openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
create remapping.txt file

	openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
------------ Format code

forge fmt
